# Network Security Automation – Ansible Container Deployment

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Ansible automation** to securely deploy and manage network services using Docker containers. The focus is on **network segmentation, service isolation, and repeatable infrastructure deployment**, reflecting real-world network security and DevOps practices.

Apache (HTTP) and FTP services were automatically provisioned into **separate Docker networks** with defined subnets to ensure controlled access and predictable network behaviour.

---

## Objectives
- Automate container deployment using Ansible playbooks
- Deploy network services in isolated environments
- Implement network segmentation using Docker subnets
- Ensure secure, repeatable, and verifiable deployments
- Apply Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles to network security

---

## Environment
- Automation Tool: Ansible
- Container Platform: Docker
- Target Systems: Kali Linux / Parrot OS
- Remote Access: SSH
- Services Deployed:
  - Apache (HTTP)
  - FTP (vsftpd)

---

## Architecture & Networking
- Apache Network: `172.10.0.0/16`
- FTP Network: `172.20.0.0/16`
- Each service deployed in a dedicated Docker bridge network
- Static IP addressing for predictable service access
- Network design validated through container inspection and connectivity testing

---

## Key Implementations

### Ansible Automation
- Automated Docker installation and configuration
- Service management using Ansible modules
- Reusable and idempotent playbooks
- SSH-based remote administration

### Container Deployment
- Creation of custom Docker bridge networks
- Deployment of Apache container using `httpd:latest`
- Deployment of FTP container using `fauria/vsftpd:latest`
- Port mapping and volume mounting
- Environment variable configuration for FTP authentication

---

## Verification & Testing
- Verified container deployment using Docker inspection commands
- Confirmed static IP assignment within configured subnets
- Tested Apache service accessibility via browser and CLI
- Validated FTP authentication and file transfer functionality
- Confirmed network isolation between service containers

---

## Security & DevOps Concepts Demonstrated
- Network segmentation and isolation
- Secure service deployment and exposure
