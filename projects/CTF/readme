# Capture The Flag (CTF) Virtual Machine

## Overview
This project involved the design and implementation of an educational Capture The Flag (CTF) virtual machine aimed at beginners in cybersecurity. The environment simulates real-world attack scenarios using common services, misconfigurations, and progressive challenges.

The goal was to introduce foundational cybersecurity concepts through hands-on problem solving in a controlled and safe environment.

## Environment
- Operating System: Ubuntu Server 18.04
- Services: FTP, SSH, Apache, HTTP/HTTPS
- Multiple Linux users with restricted access
- Custom HTML web page for initial clues

---

## Key Implementations
- Configured multiple exposed services to simulate an attack surface
- Created multiple users with isolated directories and permissions
- Embedded flags across different services and file systems
- Implemented web-based information disclosure via HTML source inspection
- Used steganography to hide flags in image and audio files
- Implemented hashing and brute-force challenges using uncommon algorithms

---

## Security Concepts Demonstrated
- Service enumeration and port scanning
- Linux privilege separation and access control
