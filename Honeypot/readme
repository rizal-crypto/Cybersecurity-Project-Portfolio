# Honeypot Lab – Attacker Behaviour Analysis

## Overview
This project involved the design and deployment of a secure honeypot lab to capture attacker interactions and analyze malware distribution techniques. The environment was carefully isolated to prevent any impact on production systems.

---

## Environment
- Honeypot System: Windows 10 Virtual Machine
- Firewall & Gateway: pfSense (WAN / LAN / DMZ)
- Log Management: ELK Stack
- Traffic Capture: WinPcap
- Deception Framework: Maltego Casefile

---

## Key Implementations
- Deployed a honeypot system exposed to external traffic
- Configured pfSense firewall rules to enforce strict isolation
- Captured attacker interactions and packet-level network traffic
- Centralized logs and traffic data using ELK Stack
- Analyzed attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)

---

## Outcomes
- Successfully captured and analyzed hostile interaction attempts
- Verified effectiveness of firewall-based isolation
- Gained insight into attacker behaviour and threat intelligence collection
- Demonstrated secure deployment of deception-based defenses

---

## Security Concepts Demonstrated
- Honeypot deployment and management
- Firewall configuration and gateway security
- Network traffic capture and forensic analysis
- Threat intelligence and attacker behaviour analysis
- Defensive security research techniques
